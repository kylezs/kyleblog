# Kyle Zsembery Blog
Just a blog I built using the JAM stack paradigm. JAM is faster, cheaper and
more secure. Make the switch today!

I write about whatever I feel like writing about. 

## Credits:
Starting pack for semantic-ui and gatsby which proved to be a pain in the ass
when trying to override semantic's defaults. When I used this:
https://github.com/pretzelhands/gatsby-starter-semantic-ui
it worked.
