# Kyle Zsembery Blog
Just a blog I built using the JAM stack paradigm. JAM is faster, cheaper and
more secure. Make the switch today!

Find it at: https://brave-curie-4693f2.netlify.com/

JAM = Javascript, APIs, Markup.

This site is super fast, try clicking a post and then the site title and do that for all posts and you won't experience much loading time at all.

Also with the Netlify CMS, which is a Markdown CMS.

## Credits:
Starting pack for semantic-ui and gatsby which proved to be a pain in the ass
when trying to override semantic's defaults. When I used this:
https://github.com/pretzelhands/gatsby-starter-semantic-ui
it worked.
